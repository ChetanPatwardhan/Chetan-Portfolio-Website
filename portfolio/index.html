              <h3 class="major">Hotel Management System</h3>
              <p>During my college years, I worked as a Front-End Developer Intern for two months at Force
                By Four Multiservice Private
                Limited. I contributed to the development of a Hotel Management System, focusing on
                creating responsive and intuitive
                user interfaces. This experience allowed me to strengthen my skills in front-end
                development and apply modern web
                technologies to real-world projects.

              <h3 class="major">Image Forgery Detection</h3>
              <p>I developed an Image Forgery Detection system aimed at identifying and analyzing tampered or
                manipulated digital images.
                The system utilizes advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect
                inconsistencies such
                as splicing, cloning, or image retouching. It includes functionalities for feature extraction, error
                level analysis, and
                metadata inspection to ensure the authenticity of images. This project allowed me to gain expertise in
                image processing,
                pattern recognition, and implementing secure validation measures for digital media.

              <p>As a Project Intern and Research & Development Intern in software engineering for 11 months during my
                Master of Technology program, I
                contributed to the
                development of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). My responsibilities included software design,
                mission planning,
                and implementing systems for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and sensor integration. This project
                provided hands-on
                experience in advanced software engineering and autonomous systems development.</p>

              <p>I designed and developed an Airline Reservation System that streamlines the process of booking,
                canceling, and managing
                flight tickets. The system includes features such as user authentication, real-time flight availability,
                seat selection,
                and payment integration. It offers an intuitive interface for users to search for flights and an admin
                panel for
                managing flight schedules and passenger details. This project enhanced my understanding of database
                management,
                efficient query handling, and creating secure and user-friendly applications</p>

              <p>I developed a clone of Airbnb, the popular vacation rental platform, replicating key functionalities
                such as property
                listings, user authentication, booking management, and search filters. The project involved building a
                responsive and
                user-friendly interface, integrating backend features to handle data storage, and ensuring smooth
                interaction between
                hosts and guests. This experience helped me enhance my skills in full-stack development, database
                design, and creating
                scalable web applications.</p>
